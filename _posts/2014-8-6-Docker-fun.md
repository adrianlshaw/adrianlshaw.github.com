title: Docker breakout fun

Another [stern](http://stealth.openwall.net/xSports/shocker.c) reminder that these popular lightweight virtualisation engines 
provide very minimal and *brittle* isolation. Quite an amusing hack! Docker seems like a great way to ship and package both 
environments and code, without the need for a full VM. Just think twice before using it for security critical containerisation.
