Markdown is booming in the community. I've never been a big fan of [ASCIIdoc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AsciiDoc), 
it offers too much for me to remember. A similar reason which stops me from using GNU Emacs day-to-day over other editors.
For writing a blog entry, Markdown delivers perfectly on the most fundamental part, which is getting _text_ onto a page!
GitHub supports Jekyll, a static page generator based off of Ruby. It's quite cool. 
Try it yourself if you are GitHub user, it certainly offers more characters than Twitter has to offer. 
I'm unsure as to what I will post on here, but expect some interesting things to appear at some point.
