	<p>Welcome! Here I share with you some summaries of some things that I've worked on that you may
	find interesting. Feel free to browse around and check out my work. If you have questions 
	or want a friendly conversation, you can reach out to me at adrianlshaw on

	Career (so far):
	<ul>
	<li><b>Principal Researcher</b> at <a href="https://www.hp.com/gb-en/hp-labs.html">HP Labs</a>, where I work hard to push the boundaries on secure hardware/software co-design in PCs and laptops.</li>
	<li><b>Security Architect</b> at <a href="https://www.arm.com">ARM</a>, where I worked on the TrustZone architecture and designed software standards, including Platform Security Architecture (PSA).</li>
	<li><b>Research Scientist</b> at <a href="https://www.hpe.com/us/en/hewlett-packard-labs.html">Hewlett Packard Enterprise (Labs)</a>, where I worked on platform security technologies for servers and network equipment.</li>
	</ul>

	Areas of interest:

<ul>

<li><b>Software:</b> hypervisors (Xen, KVM, and more), operating system (Linux, L4, Zephyr, Barrelfish and more) technologies, device drivers, security subsystems and network virtualization (SDN and DC networking)</li>
<li><b>Firmware:</b> boot security, robustness, firmware (UEFI BIOS, Trusted Firmware), secure update, trusted execution environments, secure logging and attestation, secure storage, protocols etc.</li>
<li><b>Hardware:</b> SoC security, system architecture and IP, Trusted Platform Modules (TPM), some <i>very</i> limited Verilog/FPGA experience</li>
</ul>	

<p>
I've had the privilege to work with some outstanding people in the industry, including students
as well as veterans, and I've learned a tremendous amount from them.
</p>

<p>
	Giving back to the research community is important to me. 
	I serve on the technical commitee of IEEE NetSoft conference and the <a href="https://www.secsoft-workshop.org">SecSoft</a> workshop.
	I'm available to participate in others.
</p>

<p>I've also represented my employers at various industry standards bodies, 
	including the Trusted Computing Group (TCG), Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), 
    Distributed Management Task Force (DMTF) and ETSI.</p>


Some interesting (public) projects I've worked on that may interest you or others. They deserve
proper writeups and I hope to get round to that soon.
But for now here is an unordered list and brief descriptions.

	<ul>
		<li>Zephyr-CHERI (more to come on that).
			<ul>
			<li>CHERI is an extension to instruction sets that provides very precise memory compartmentalization. </li>
			<li>Zephyr is an emerging RTOS for microcontrollers and a promising ecosystem. </li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Platform Security Architecture (PSA) for TrustZone based IoT devices. This later became a part of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSA_Certified">PSA Certified</a></li>

			<li>Firmware Framework M (FF-M)</li>		
			<li>Mbed SPM: An extension of the Mbed RTOS that provides a secure partition manager for Cortex-M microcontrollers without TrustZone. <br />An evolution of the <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/practical-realtime-operating-system-security-for-the-masses/70399398">uVisor project</a> to implement PSA principles.</li>

Patents are a "thing" in the industry. 
They're not a good measure of innovation, 
but they're <a href="https://patents.google.com/?inventor=Adrian+Shaw,Adrian+Laurence+Shaw&assignee=Hewlett+Packard+Development+Co,Arm+Limited,Izuma+Tech+Inc,Arm+Cloud+Technology%2c+Inc,Hewlett+Packard+Enterprise+Development+Lp">something</a>.
</p>

Well... that's all for now. I hope you enjoy your visit.
